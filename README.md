I wanted to try out and make tablet/card weaving. But it was a hassle to make patterns manually, and the existing solutions were really outdated and limited.

So i wrote my own little tool to do what i wanted. Create and view patterns tru the browser.

The code is a mess and the ui is not pretty. But it's functional and better than anything i've found. Feel free to use it however you like an if there is any issues, contact me thru github and i will try to fix it.

it's written in pure javascipt, css and html without any dependencies. dwonload and run the .html file, or visit the io page here:

saving patterns is done tru plain human readable JSON text. Just save the text it gives and you can use the text to get the pattern back anytime.
